1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
- The client, Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They have a public web interface and want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security to protect their client data and financial information by adding a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. Specifically, When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum.  

2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
- Dependency check tools were utilized to ensure no new vulnerability was introduced in the code, as well as all the known vulnerabilities, have been addressed properly. Developing secure code ensures that the application is not vulnerable to cyberattacks and in the event of an attack, it does not lead to a severe disaster. Practicing the software security fundamentals not only protect customers' sensitive information but also protect the company's reputation as a trustworthy company that prioritizes customers' safety and security. 

3. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
- Although it was challenging, it was helpful. Manually checking the code for vulnerabilities was more challenging than utilizing the dependency check tool to discover dependency's vulnerabilities.

4. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
- Utilizing outdated versions of dependencies were caused most of the vulnerabilities which were addressed by updating to the latest version to ensure all the known bugs have been fixed. Different security testing of the code specifically penetration testing will help to optimally assess vulnerabilities and determine appropriate mitigation techniques in the future. 

5. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- 

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- 

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
